# IronmanDataAnalysis
Data Analysis of 70.3 &amp; 140.6 distance triathlons from 2015 - 2021

This project started as a way of amassing a large amount of data from ironman sponsored races from a website via webscraping. The hope with the large amounts of 
data is to identify key metrics that impact an athletes peformance. Currently the project is on hiatus as I have been unable to find an appropriate weather API that
will not cost me thousands for the amount of data points there are.
